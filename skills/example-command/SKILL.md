## Execution Phases



**DRY-RUN RULE:** Before executing any destructive or external operation, first perform a dry-run to preview what will happen. Show the user what actions would be taken, then ask for confirmation before proceeding.
> **[UNIVERSAL DRY-RUN / SIMULATION RULE]**
> If the user requests execution in `--dry-run` mode or asks for a "simulation", the agent will **NOT** execute commands that alter system state or call destructive MCP tools in the Action Phase.
> Instead, the agent will print the exact payload (JSON, code block, or parameters) it planned to execute, and will wait for explicit human approval.
### 1. Preparation Phase
- Load references and verify prerequisites
- Resolve target scope

### 2. Action Phase
- Execute the main workflow (original content below preserves existing steps)

### 3. Verification Phase
- Verify output matches expected results

## Context & Triggers
**When to use this skill:**
- TODO: Add specific triggers for this skill
- Triggers: "example-command", "use example-command"



# Example Command (Skill Format)

This demonstrates the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` layout for user-invoked slash commands. It is functionally identical to the legacy `commands/example-command.md` format — both are loaded the same way; only the file layout differs.


## Prerequisites
- [ ] Read access to target files/directories
- [ ] Write access for auto-fix operations


## Arguments

The user invoked this with: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. Parse the arguments provided by the user
2. Perform the requested action using allowed tools
3. Report results back to the user

## Frontmatter Options Reference

Skills in this layout support these frontmatter fields:

- **name**: Skill identifier (matches directory name)
- **description**: Short description shown in /help
- **argument-hint**: Hints for command arguments shown to user
- **allowed-tools**: Pre-approved tools for this skill (reduces permission prompts)
- **model**: Override the model (e.g., "haiku", "sonnet", "opus")

## Example Usage

```
/example-command my-argument
/example-command arg1 arg2
```


## Guardrails (Critical Rules)
- **NEVER** execute destructive operations without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** verify target exists before operating
- **ALWAYS** handle errors gracefully — skip with warning, don't crash
