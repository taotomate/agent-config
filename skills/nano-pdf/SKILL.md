## Execution Phases



**DRY-RUN RULE:** Before executing any destructive or external operation, first perform a dry-run to preview what will happen. Show the user what actions would be taken, then ask for confirmation before proceeding.
> **[UNIVERSAL DRY-RUN / SIMULATION RULE]**
> If the user requests execution in `--dry-run` mode or asks for a "simulation", the agent will **NOT** execute commands that alter system state or call destructive MCP tools in the Action Phase.
> Instead, the agent will print the exact payload (JSON, code block, or parameters) it planned to execute, and will wait for explicit human approval.
### 1. Preparation Phase
- Load references and verify prerequisites
- Resolve target scope

### 2. Action Phase
- Execute the main workflow (original content below preserves existing steps)

### 3. Verification Phase
- Verify output matches expected results

## Context & Triggers
**When to use this skill:**
- TODO: Add specific triggers for this skill
- Triggers: "nano-pdf", "use nano-pdf"



# nano-pdf

Edit PDFs using natural-language instructions. Point it at a page and describe what to change.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended — already available in Hermes)
uv pip install nano-pdf

# Or with pip
pip install nano-pdf
```

## Usage

```bash
nano-pdf edit <file.pdf> <page_number> "<instruction>"
```

## Examples

```bash
# Change a title on page 1
nano-pdf edit deck.pdf 1 "Change the title to 'Q3 Results' and fix the typo in the subtitle"

# Update a date on a specific page
nano-pdf edit report.pdf 3 "Update the date from January to February 2026"

# Fix content
nano-pdf edit contract.pdf 2 "Change the client name from 'Acme Corp' to 'Acme Industries'"
```

## Notes

- Page numbers may be 0-based or 1-based depending on version — if the edit hits the wrong page, retry with ±1
- Always verify the output PDF after editing (use `read_file` to check file size, or open it)
- The tool uses an LLM under the hood — requires an API key (check `nano-pdf --help` for config)
- Works well for text changes; complex layout modifications may need a different approach


## Guardrails (Critical Rules)
- **NEVER** execute destructive operations without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** verify target exists before operating
- **ALWAYS** handle errors gracefully — skip with warning, don't crash
