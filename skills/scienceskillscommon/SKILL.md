## Execution Phases



**DRY-RUN RULE:** Before executing any destructive or external operation, first perform a dry-run to preview what will happen. Show the user what actions would be taken, then ask for confirmation before proceeding.
> **[UNIVERSAL DRY-RUN / SIMULATION RULE]**
> If the user requests execution in `--dry-run` mode or asks for a "simulation", the agent will **NOT** execute commands that alter system state or call destructive MCP tools in the Action Phase.
> Instead, the agent will print the exact payload (JSON, code block, or parameters) it planned to execute, and will wait for explicit human approval.
### 1. Preparation Phase
- Load references and verify prerequisites
- Resolve target scope

### 2. Action Phase
- Execute the main workflow (original content below preserves existing steps)

### 3. Verification Phase
- Verify output matches expected results

## Context & Triggers
**When to use this skill:**
- TODO: Add specific triggers for this skill
- Triggers: "scienceskillscommon", "use scienceskillscommon"



# Science Skills Common

This is a shared Python package, not an agent skill. Skills import it as:

```python
from science_skills.skills.scienceskillscommon import http_client
```

Each skill declares this as a dependency in its inline `uv` script header, so it
is installed automatically on first use.

This SKILL.md file is included so that standard skill installers automatically
discover and install this package alongside the skills that depend on it.


## Prerequisites
- [ ] Read access to target files/directories
- [ ] Write access for auto-fix operations



## Guardrails (Critical Rules)
- **NEVER** execute destructive operations without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** verify target exists before operating
- **ALWAYS** handle errors gracefully — skip with warning, don't crash
