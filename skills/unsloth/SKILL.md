## Execution Phases


**DRY-RUN RULE:** Before executing any destructive or external operation, first perform a dry-run to preview what will happen. Show the user what actions would be taken, then ask for confirmation before proceeding.
### 1. Preparation Phase
- Load references and verify prerequisites
- Resolve target scope

### 2. Action Phase
- Execute the main workflow (original content below preserves existing steps)

### 3. Verification Phase
- Verify output matches expected results

## Context & Triggers
**When to use this skill:**
- Triggers: "unsloth", "use unsloth"

## Guardrails (Critical Rules)
- **NEVER** execute destructive operations without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** verify target exists before operating
- **ALWAYS** handle errors gracefully — skip with warning, don't crash
